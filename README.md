Distressed Airline Stocks and How Options data aid Forecasting.

In this post I want to bring attention of #investors to Distressed Airline Stocks that experienced severe sell-off due to Covid19.

If you want to know what is #overreaction then look at the #alaska stock price slumping from $70 to $25 due to expected negative revenues for the next several quarters. 

Opportunities come with crisis - and the idea of this post is to find out if the airline stocks are this opportunities.

The green line on the graph shows the ATM call option prices that I retrieved from #yahoo finance. 

The orange confidence band is based on the probability of option ending up ITM or OTM based on the historical data. Particularly, it shows how many times the option issued ATM ended up ITM or OTM in the past.

Unfortunately, I couldn't get the data. Therefore, I approximated it with stock volatility. 

If I could afford buying the data for $3k from #cboe, I could construct #alpha factor based on the data. The strategy would identify the top decile of stocks with the highest above green line volatility and the lowest below green line volatility.

You can find the code and more graphs with #delta,#spirit on my github: https://github.com/rustemshinkaruk/Airlines-Investing
